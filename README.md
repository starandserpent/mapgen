map generator stuff

This is a world map generator I prototyped for a game I was building using https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx and https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib

It's based on the tutorial found - http://www.jgallant.com/procedurally-generating-wrapping-world-maps-in-unity-csharp-part-1/

The code was experimental and moved around a lot and I can't attest to the current state of it. It will compile but some things
like shaders may not be enabled.

Here are some screenshots / videos / albums of the types of maps the generator can produce :
